## The Case for Markup Languages for Typesetting

### Markup and Typesetting

*Typesetting* is the process of specifying the details of how a written document is represented visually, from the margins widths and the page size, to the font choice, style, and spacing.

In the days of the printing press, a publisher would read through a written document and add notes in the margin on how the document was to be printed. The typesetter would then follow these notes — the *Markup* — to set the physical type and generate the final printed document.

This process, *Markup* and *Typesetting*, is still how all modern day software generates written documents. While popular word processing software like *Microsoft Word* hide the mechanics from the user, underneath the hood, every bolded word and indented paragraph is specified by a *Markup language* that tells the software how to represent the document onscreen or a printer how to render it.

### WYSIWYG *vs* WYSIWYM

For most day to day purposes, word processors like *Microsoft Word* are fast and convenient. However, if you've ever written a long document (*e.g*: over 100 pages), or one with complex structure (chapters or nested subsections) or embedded images, you may have found the convenience quickly gives way to frustration and chaos.

![tweet-image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kjmclean/intro_to_markdown_and_pandoc/master/tweet_image.png)

*Microsoft Word* is what is known as a *WYSIWYG* (*What You See is What You Get*). The tradeoff for the speed and convenience of real-time typsetting is a sometimes inexplicable and often infuriating lack of control of how the document is formatted.

The alternative to the *WYSIWYG* is a *WYSIWYM* (*What You See I What You Meant*). A *WYSIWYM* usually requires the user to annotate their document as they write with a specific *Markup language*, then pass the document through some form of interpreter in order to generate the final document. While this process sacrifices the readability of real-time typsetting, and requires a certain degree of proficiency with the markup language of choice, a *WYSIWYM* (in theory) provides the user complete control over every aspect of the final document.

### Common Markup Languages

#### **html**

The most popular *Markup* language in the world is probably *html*, which is used to determine how nearly all text on the web is rendered. For a sense of how *html* markup looks, try right-clicking on this page and selecting *View Page Source*. Each one of those colons, quotes, and parentheses provides typsetting instructions for your browser. The browser then consults the page's associated *Cascading Style Sheet* (*CSS*) on how each markup instruction should be rendered onscreen. Two different *CSS* style sheets will generate two different web pages (*e.g*: different layout, text sizes, or colors).

#### ![LaTeX](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\LaTeX)

![LaTeX](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\LaTeX) and its progenitor ![TeX](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\TeX) (pronounced "laytech" and "tech", the last letter is a Greek *Chi*, not an 'x') are part of a family of *WYSIWYM* languages originally developed for typsetting printed documents that is still widely used for typesetting books, journal articles, and theses. Like, *html*, user annotates a written document with specific markup tags then passes it through a ![LaTeX](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\LaTeX) interpreter that renders the final document based on the *Class* and *packages* specified by the user. While it has a steep learning curve and can be intimidating for the novice user, it is an extremely powerful tool with a large (if diminishing) user base. If you're interested in trying your hand at ![LaTeX](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\LaTeX), start with our tutorial [here](https://github.com/mrsunny0/LaTeX-thesis-proposal).

#### Markdown

Markdown is the youngest and simplest of common markup languages. Variations of it are used in many websites and applications, such as *reddit*, *Wordpress*, *Slack*, and *WhatsApp*. If you've ever bolded text with a couple of asterisks, you've used *Markdown*.

## The Simplicity of Markdown

The beauty and power of Markdown lie in its simplicity. It is easy to write and easy to read.

Compare, for example, some common markup tags between *html*, ![LaTeX](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\LaTeX), and their *Markdown* equivalents:

| Markup 				| html 													|
|:--------------------- | :-----------------------------------------------------|
|  Section Heading		|  \<h1 id="your-section"\>Your Section\<\/h1\> 		|
|  Subsection Heading 1	|  \<h2 id="your-section-1"\>Your Section\<\/h2\>		|
|  Subsection Heading 2	|  \<h3 id="your-section-2"\>Your Section\<\/h3\>		|
|  Bold Text			|  \<p\>\<em\>Bold\<\/em\>\<\/p\>						|
|  Italicized Text		|  \<p\>\<em\>italics\<\/em\>\<\/p\>					|
|  Bold italics 		|  \<p\>\<em\>\<em\>bold italics\<\/em\>\<\/em\>\<\/p\>	|
|  Superscripts 		|  \<p\>10\<sup\>5\<\/sup\>\<\/p\>						|
|  Subscripts 			|  \<p\>H\<sub\>2\<\/sub\>O\<\/p\>						|

	Table 1. Common html markup tags.



| Markup 				|  ![LaTeX](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\LaTeX)													|
|:----------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|  Section Heading 1	| \\section\{Your Section\}\\label\{your-section\}			|
|  Section Heading 2	| \\subsection\{Your Section\}\\label\{your-section-1\}		|
|  Section Heading 3	| \\subsubsection\{Your Section\}\\label\{your-section-2\}	|
|  Bold Text			| \\emph\{Bold\}  											|
|  Italicized Text		| \\emph\{italics\}											|
|  Bold italics 		| \\emph\{\\emph\{bold italics\}\}							|
|  Superscripts 		| 10\\textsuperscript\{5\}									|
|  Subscripts	 		| H\\textsubscript\{2\}O									|

	Table 2. Common ![LaTeX](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\LaTeX) markup tags.



| Markup 				| Markdown	 		 	|
|:----------------------|:----------------------|
|  Section Heading 1	| \# Your Section		|
|  Section Heading 2	| \## Your Section		|
|  Section Heading 3	| \### Your Section 	|
|  Bold Text			| \*Bold\*				|
|  Italicized Text		| \_italics\_			|
|  Bold italics 		| \*\_bold italics\_\*	|
|  Superscripts 		| 10\^5\^				|
|  Subscripts 			| H\~2\~O				|

	Table 3. Common Markdown markup tags.

Compared to the other two, *Markdown* is much more intuitive and much less disruptive to read and write. More importantly, however, translators such as *pandoc* (see below) allow you to write in *Markdown* then convert your document. So, if you need to write text for a webpage, or want to try ![LaTeX](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\LaTeX) with training wheels, *Markdown* + *pandoc* is for you.

## An Introduction to _pandoc_

### Pandoc: a universal markup interconversion tool

Regardless of what writing software or markup language you prefer, there will come a time when obstinate collaborators or strict document submission guidelines will force you to change the format of your document. Enter [_pandoc_](https://pandoc.org/).

_pandoc_ is a (near) universal markup translator. Since every word processing format has a markup language at its core, converting from one to another is just a matter of replacing one language's markup for another. If you have a complex, thousand page document written in ![LaTeX](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\LaTeX), and need to convert it to _Microsoft_ _Word_, a single _pandoc_ command will do most of the work.

#### Installing _pandoc_ and other useful tools

Guidelines for installing _pandoc_ on various operating systems can be found [here](https://pandoc.org/installing.html).

To get the most out of the rest of this demo, I recommend using a plain text editor with good syntax highlighting support, such as [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/). Activating the _Markdown_ syntax highliting in either of these programs will be helpful (see [here](https://atom.io/packages/language-markdown) for Atom, or [here](https://blog.mariusschulz.com/2014/12/16/how-to-set-up-sublime-text-for-a-vastly-better-markdown-writing-experience) for Sublime Text).

For the more advanced ![LaTeX](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\LaTeX) examples below, you'll need to install one of the many available ![LaTeX](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\LaTeX) distributions. I recommend [MikTeX](https://miktex.org/download).

Lastly, this demo assumes a certain degree of familiarity with a \*\nix command line and the _bash_ shell. If you don't know how to change directories and call programs from the command line, you may wish to familiarize yourself with these basics before proceeding.

### Your first _pandoc_ conversion

Save this [sample_markdown_file.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kjmclean/intro_to_markdown_and_pandoc/master/sample_markdown_file.md) in your working directory. Open it with the text editor of your choice and take a look. You should see a few paragraphs of text marked up with common Markdown markups (_e.g._ \#, \*, _etc_).

Let's try converting it to a pdf with _pandoc_. Type the following into the command line:

```
pandoc sample_markdown_file.md -o example_01.pdf

```

Open the example_01.pdf and take a look. You see a nicely rendered document with nested heading levels. All the markup is gone. What _pandoc_ just did was take the Markdown file, translate the Markdown markup into ![LaTeX](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\LaTeX), then render the ![LaTeX](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\LaTeX) as a pdf.

If you wanted to stop at the ![LaTeX](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\LaTeX) intermediate, you can. Try this on the command line:

```
pandoc sample_markdown_file.md -o example_02.tex
```

If you open example_02.tex with your text editor, you should the same text as the Mardown file, except extensively marked-up with ![LaTeX](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\LaTeX). 

### Converting to _Microsoft_ _Word_ .docx from Markdown

_pandoc_ can also convert Markdown markup to _MS_ _Word_ markup. Try directly converting the sample_markdown_file.md to a .docx file by entering the following into the command line.

```
pandoc sample_markdown_file.md -o example_03.docx

```

Open example_03.docx in _MS_ _Word_ and take a look. You should see the document rendered into the default settings of your _MS_ _Word_.


If the default settings aren't to your liking, you can always use a different document (.docx) or template (.dotx) for conversion. 

For example, download [msword1.dotx](https://github.com/kjmclean/intro_to_markdown_and_pandoc/raw/master/msword1.dotx) into your working directory. Open the file in _Word_ and take a look. You should see an abbreviated article style after the BECL website. If we use this document as a reference, we can convert our Markdown file into that same style.

Try running the following on the command line:


```
pandoc sample_markdown_file.md --reference-doc msword1.dotx -o example_04.docx
```

Open example_04.docx and take a look. The sample_markdown_file.md should now be in the style as msword1.dotx.

This will work for any pre-generated _MS_ _Word_ style template or document. Try it again. Download [msword2.dotx](https://github.com/kjmclean/intro_to_markdown_and_pandoc/raw/master/msword2.dotx) into your working directory. Open it up in _Word_ and take a look. This time, the file should appear blank. However, the style information is still encoded. Try converting your Markdown file with msword2.dotx as a reference:

```
pandoc sample_markdown_file.md --reference-doc msword2.dotx -o example_05.docx
```

Open example_05.docx using _MS_ _Word_. See the difference in formatting? 

Try it again with any _MS_ _Word_ file of your own on your computer. _pandoc_ should convert the Markdown file such that the final output matches the reference document's style.


### Advanced: Putting ![LaTeX](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\LaTeX) in your Markdown

#### ![LaTeX](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\LaTeX) Symbols

![LaTeX](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\LaTeX) has long been the language of choice for writing out complex math equations. You can find a list of ![LaTeX](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\LaTeX) commands for different math and scientific symbols [here](https://oeis.org/wiki/List_of_LaTeX_mathematical_symbols). _Pandoc_ will recognize and render ![LaTeX](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\LaTeX) symbols within markdown if you surround them with dollar signs.

Open up the *sample_markdown_file.md* in your text editor and try adding some of the following ![LaTeX](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\LaTeX) symbols in different places:

```  
$\mu$
$\pi$
$\phi$
$\infty$
$\leq$
$\neq$

```

Save your edited file and convert it to pdf:

```
pandoc sample_markdown_file.md -o example_06.pdf

```

Open the example_06.pdf and see how they rendered. 

#### ![LaTeX](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\LaTeX) inline Typesetting

Since _pandoc_ converts markdown to pdf by way of ![LaTeX](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\LaTeX), you can include direct ![LaTeX](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\LaTeX) code in your markdown document.

For example, try adding this unassuming command somewhere in sample_markdown_file.md.

```
\LaTeX
```
Save the file, and try converting to pdf:

```
pandoc sample_markdown_file.md -o example_07.pdf

```

If everything worked, you should see the stylized, offset rendering of ![LaTeX](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\LaTeX) instead of the mixed case LaTeX you typed in.

The ability to embed ![LaTeX](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\LaTeX) commands within your Markdown document can provide added control over the layout of your document. Try adding the following command after the first section in the sample_markdown_file.md:

```
\pagebreak
```

Save the file, and convert to pdf:

```
pandoc sample_markdown_file.md -o example_08.pdf

```

Open up example_08.pdf and take a look. You should see the page ends exactly where you pasted the command and begins again on the next page.

### Changing Class Options with YAML

Every ![LaTeX](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\LaTeX) document has an associated class (_e.g._ Book, Thesis, Letter, Article), and every document class is defined by a set of defaults settings (_e.g._ font, font size, margins, _etc_) that can be adjusted and customized by the user. Normally, a ![LaTeX](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\LaTeX) document will begin with a _preamble_ that specifies these settings. 

These same class features and settings can be sepecified in a Markdown document prior to _pandoc_ conversion using a _YAML_ ("Yet Another Markup Language") block. 

Try adding the following to the very beginning of the sample_markdown_file.md:

```
---
mainfont: Helvetica
fontsize: 12pt
urlcolor: cyan

---

```

Save the file and convert it to pdf. Note that this time we are calling a specific ![LaTeX](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\LaTeX) engine (xelatex) to perform the conversion. 

```
pandoc sample_markdown_file.md --pdf-engine=xelatex -o example_09.pdf
```

Open example_09.pdf and take a look. Can you see the changes? Open sample_markdown_file.md again, but make the following changes:

```
---
mainfont: Courier New
fontsize: 10pt
urlcolor: red

---
```

Save and convert it into a pdf:

```
pandoc sample_markdown_file.md --pdf-engine=xelatex -o example_10.pdf
```

Open example_10.pdf and take a look. 

The _pandoc_ Markdown to ![LaTeX](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\LaTeX) conversion allows you to adjust nearly any setting you can change in ![LaTeX](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\LaTeX) by specifying it in the YAML, including calling and loading ![LaTeX](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\LaTeX) packages. For further documentation, including the default settings, see [here](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#variables-for-latex).


### References and Citations

If you're using Markdown for academic writing, you can easily pass citations through pandoc with the pandoc-citeproc package. To install pandoc-citeproc, you'll need to use the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) manager.

```
brew install pandoc pandoc-citeproc
```

Most commonly used reference management software packages will generate  ![LaTeX](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\LaTeX) compatible bibliographies. For this example, I used [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) with the [BetterBibTeX](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/installation/). Zotero and BibTeX convert your reference list into a ![LaTeX](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\LaTeX) readable bibliography file and provide a unique key for you to call in text. 

Try pasting the following at the end of the sample_markdown_file.md and saving it:

```
### Recommended Reading

Two important early texts on the theory of data visualization were Edward Tufte's seminal work, _The_ _Visual_ _Display_ _of_ _Quantitative_ _Information_ [@tufteVisualDisplayQuantitative2015] and William S. Cleveland's _Visualizing_ _Data_ [@clevelandVisualizingData1993]. Leland Wilkinson's _Grammar_ _of_ _Graphics_ [@wilkinsonGrammarGraphics2012] was the first work to establish a comprehensive nomenclature for data visualization. The **BE** **Communication** **Lab** recommends Jean-Luc Dumont's _Trees,_ _Maps,_ _and_ _Theorums_ [@doumontTreesMapsTheorems2009] as an introductory text on data visualization and communication.

## Works Cited
```

See the reference keys starting with the square parentheses and \@ symbols? They are stand-ins for how the citation in the Markdown text. When converting through pandoc, we will specity a citation style and the final document will be rendered in that style.

Download this bibliography file, [pandoc_demo.bib](https://github.com/kjmclean/intro_to_markdown_and_pandoc/raw/master/pandoc_demo.bib), and this citation style file (from the journal, Cell), [cell.csl](https://github.com/kjmclean/intro_to_markdown_and_pandoc/raw/master/cell.csl), into your working directory. Now, convert it to a pdf while calling the bibliography and citation style:

```
pandoc sample_markdown_file.md --filter pandoc-citeproc --bibliography=pandoc_demo.bib --csl=cell.csl -o example_11.pdf
```

Open up example_11.pdf and scroll to the end and take a look. You should see the citation keys replaced by the author names and years, and a final reference list, all conforming to the Cell style guidelines.

You can find style files for other journals [here](https://www.zotero.org/styles). Try downloading the .csl file of your favorite journal using it in the place of the cell.csl.


You can even use this method to generate an _MS_ _Word_ file with full citations:

```
pandoc sample_markdown_file.md --filter pandoc-citeproc --bibliography=pandoc_demo.bib --csl=cell.csl -o example_12.docx

```
